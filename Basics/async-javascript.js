*Execution context --> execute oneline at one time
*                  --> call stack , Memory heap

*                  each operation waits for the last one to be complete before executing 


*Blocking code vs Non Blocking Code

*Blocking code --> Block the flow of program 
*              --> Read the file sync 

*Non Blocking code --> Don't not block the flow of program
*                  --> Read file async
